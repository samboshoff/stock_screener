# stock-screener
A personal project to screen for investment opportunities

# Refactoring to do:
Create orchestrator functions for separate parts? i.e. a function that groups calculate_MAs, calculate_ma_indicators, latest_date_df, and screener_filter_on_criteria into one function? 

Whats the proper formatting for functions? i.e. line break before return etc
