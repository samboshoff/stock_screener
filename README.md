# stock-screener
A personal project to screen for investment opportunities

# Refactoring to do:
Remove main orchestrator function from class?  

Whats the proper formatting for functions? i.e. line break before return etc

# pickup
refactor files that output to portfolio.csv. Need to set that as a variable we pass in main. Enables use to re-use the functions for the back-tester
